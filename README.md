# Hand Gesture Recognition and Detection

## Description
This project implements real-time hand gesture recognition and detection using OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and NumPy. It allows you to interact with your computer or applications through hand gestures.

## Prerequisites
### Software:
- Visual Studio Code (or your preferred code editor)
- Python (version 3.6 or later recommended)

### Hardware:
- A webcam or other video capturing device (optional for hand detection)

## Installation
1. **Download and Install Dependencies:**
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/.
   - Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Ensure you add Python to your system's PATH environment variable during installation.

2. **Create Virtual Environment:** Open a terminal and navigate to your desired project directory (e.g., using `cd Desktop` to create a folder on your desktop). Create a virtual environment named `venv` to isolate project dependencies:

   **Windows:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   **Mac and Linux:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Project Requirements:** Inside the activated virtual environment, install the following required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow numpy
   ```

## Usage
1. **Navigate to Project Directory:** Make sure you're in your project directory using the `cd` command in the terminal.

2. **Run Scripts:** Execute the scripts to launch the functionalities:
   - For hand detection:
     ```
     python hand_detection.py
     ```
   - For gesture recognition (replace `gestures.py` with your actual script name):
     ```
     python gestures.py
     ```
